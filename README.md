# Magic the Swedening

Search for a Magic the Gathering card or get a random one, and translate it into Swedish. Using the powerful Scryfall API.

Made as a part of an assignment for the course Web and Mobile App development during the second year at Changemaker Educations Web and App development program in 2023.

## What I Learned

This is the companion piece to the [Weekly Meal Planner](https://github.com/freddiekaplan-cme/WeeklyMealPlanner) as two parts of an assignment in a web app course. This one required the use of an API and since I love Magic the Gathering I once again turned to the great Scryfall API.

I had an idea about translating cards to Swedish so I found an NPM package that could do the translation. I also spent a lot of time on the SCSS which was all new to me and felt like a more powerful version of regular CSS.

I like the idea of ending up with a "real" finished web app even though this is "just" a course assignment, and using API's really make that happen.
