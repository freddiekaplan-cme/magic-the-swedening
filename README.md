# Magic the Swedening

Search for a Magic the Gathering card or get a random one, and translate it into Swedish. Using the powerful Scryfall API.

## What I Learned

This is the companion piece to the [Weekly Meal Planner](https://github.com/freddiekaplan-cme/WeeklyMealPlanner) as two parts of an assignment in a web app course. This one required the use of an API and since I love Magic the Gathering I decided to use the great Scryfall API which I've worked with before.

I had an idea about translating cards to Swedish so I found an NPM package that could do the actual translation part. I also spent a lot of time on the SCSS which was all new to me and felt like a more powerful version of regular CSS. Since there were some initial loading of the translated card, I decided to spice things up with an animation and tried out Lottie. A fun experience!
